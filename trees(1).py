    insert
        There are two situations at the insertion point:
        
        1. The node does not have a value. After sorting the array, 
           the midpoint of the dimension is taken out, and then the midpoint is divided. 
           The array before the midpoint is inserted into the left subtree, and then into the right subtree. 
           Repeat until all inserts are complete.
           
        2. If the node exists, the data is sorted and divided by the midpoint. 
           The array before the midpoint is inserted into the left subtree, 
           and the array after the midpoint is inserted into the right subtree. 
           Repeat the above operations until the first case occurs, and then the first case.
        
        Note: The dimension of each sort comparison can be depth%k. For example, 
        the point created this time is a two-dimensional point, so k=2

    range
        You have to have a minimum point and a maximum point to get the interval.
        
        First, determine whether each dimension of the point of the node is within the given dimension range. 
        If so, add the point to the list; otherwise, do not add it to the list.

        To determine whether the point in this dimension is not less than the given minimum value, 
        if not, then search the left subtree.
        
        Then judge whether the point is not greater than the given maximum value in this dimension.
        If not, search the right subtree.
        
        Then judge whether the hyperplane distance of another subtree is less than the minimum distance at present.
        If it is less, the other subtree may have a smaller value, so it also needs to search.
        
        Repeat until the entire tree has been searched.

3. When doing range queries, the time complexity is affected by the balance of the tree.
    The best case
       The tree presents a perfectly balanced state, when the time complexity is O(log n)
        
    The worst case
        The tree presents a completely unbalanced state.
        At this time, it is necessary to check whether all points are located in the given interval,
        and the time complexity is O(n)
